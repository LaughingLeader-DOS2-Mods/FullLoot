Full Loot for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
=======

# Features:  
* Every character fully drops all their loot. Traders drop their full trade treasure.
* Gold amounts dropped from traders can be balanced. Defaults to 1/4 of the original amount of gold (can be disabled in the settings menu).
* Equipment (Armor/Weapons) can be configured to drop, though this isn't fully recommended, as many NPCs have equipment not meant to be equipped by players.
* "Full Loot PVP" can be enabled, allowing players to loot players from other parties when dealing the killing blow.
